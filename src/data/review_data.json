This egg substitute is made with chickpea flour, which means it's packed with protein and totally soy-free. Plus, it comes in a variety 3-pack, so you can switch up your breakfast routine and never get bored.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to make omelets and scrambles with this egg mix. Simply whisk it together with water and pour it into a hot pan, just like you would with real eggs. The texture is spot-on, and it even has a slightly eggy flavor thanks to the addition of nutritional yeast. \n\nBut the real test was whether or not this egg mix could hold up in other recipes. I'm happy to report that it did not disappoint. I used it as an egg substitute in muffins, waffles, and even brownies, and everything turned out great. I was especially impressed with how fluffy my muffins were, thanks to the addition of baking powder in the mix.\n\nOf course, no product is perfect, and there are a few cons to this egg substitute. First off, the color is a bit off-putting. It's a little on the grey side, which can be a bit jarring if you're used to bright yellow scrambled eggs. Additionally, the flavor is not quite the same as real eggs, so if you're looking for an exact dupe, this might not be for you. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend Nummy Nibbles Certified Vegan Egg Mix to anyone looking for an egg substitute that's easy to use and versatile. Whether you're making omelets, brownies, or anything in between, this egg mix has got you covered.

            "content": "Are you tired of scrolling through Pinterest only to find recipes that call for eggs? As someone with a flax seed egg intolerance, I feel your pain. That's why I love Bob's Red Mill, Egg Substitute. This 12 oz package is a lifesaver for those of us who can't enjoy the real thing.\n\nFirst off, this egg substitute is super versatile. You can use it as a substitute for 2 eggs in brownies, a flax egg substitute in your favorite muffin recipe, or even an egg replacement in pancakes. It's the perfect egg substitute for cake mix too! Plus, it's gluten-free and vegan, making it a great option for anyone with dietary restrictions.\n\nOne of the best things about Bob's Red Mill egg substitute is that it's easy to use. You just mix 1 tablespoon of the powder with 2 tablespoons of water to replace one egg. It's that simple! No more cracking eggs and separating the yolks and whites. Plus, it's much more convenient than using applesauce as an egg replacement.\n\nWhile there are many pros to Bob's Red Mill egg substitute, there are a few cons too. One minor issue is the color. The powder is a yellowish color, which can affect the appearance of white cakes or cupcakes. Additionally, it's not really an egg substitute for meatloaf or meatballs, as those recipes require a binder that needs to be denser than what the egg substitute provides.\n\nOverall, Bob's Red Mill, Egg Substitute, 12 oz is a fantastic egg replacement for anyone with an egg white allergy or egg yolk substitute needs. It's perfect for those who love to bake but can't enjoy traditional recipes that call for eggs.

Either way, the G.Q.F. Manufacturing 1602N Hova-Bator Incubator might just be what you need!\n\nAs someone who's allergic to eggs and loves to experiment in the kitchen, I was skeptical at first about reviewing an incubator. But once I realized that this little machine can help you hatch your own chickens (or other poultry) and eventually have your own eggs, I was intrigued.\n\nFirst things first: the Hova-Bator is easy to assemble and use, even for a beginner like me. It comes with a wafer thermostat that ensures the temperature remains constant and accurate, so you don't have to worry about your future chicks getting too cold or too hot. The incubator also has a thermal air flow system that helps to dry the chicks after they hatch, which is essential for their health.\n\nThe optional egg turner is a great feature if you don't want to manually turn the eggs several times a day, and it's compatible with most egg sizes except for goose eggs. However, if you're a fan of DIY and prefer to turn the eggs yourself, you can get the Hova-Bator without the egg turner.\n\nWho would the Hova-Bator be a good fit for? Well, if you're a backyard chicken keeper who wants to expand your flock, or if you're interested in sustainable living and want to raise your own poultry for eggs and/or meat, this incubator can be a game-changer. On the other hand, if you're an egg-free baker who's tired of using the same old egg substitutes in your recipes, you might want to consider getting your own chickens and using their eggs in your baking. Just a thought!\n\nPros:\n- Easy to assemble and use\n- Wafer thermostat ensures temperature accuracy\n- Thermal air flow system helps dry the chicks after hatching\n- Optional egg turner available\n- Can hatch a variety of poultry\n\nCons:\n- Not suitable for goose eggs\n- Returned items subject to 20% restocking fee\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a fun and unique way to hatch your own chickens or other poultry, the G.Q.F.

If you're on the keto train, or just trying to cut back on sugar, this is a total game-changer. But even better - it actually tastes like sugar! And not that gross artificial sweetener taste, either. This stuff is legit.\n\nI know what you're thinking - \"But Emma, does it actually work in baking?\" Friends, I'm happy to report that yes, it does. Not only does it work, but it *browns like table sugar*. Say goodbye to weirdly pale cookies and cakes.

This means it won't spike your blood sugar levels like regular sugar does, making it a great option for those with egg sensitivity or sudden egg intolerance in adults. Plus, it's vegan-friendly, so it's a great option for anyone avoiding animal products.\n\nPros:\n- Zero calories, sugar, and net carbs\n- Tastes like sugar, without the artificial aftertaste\n- Browns like table sugar in baking\n- Non-glycemic, won't spike blood sugar levels\n- Vegan-friendly\n\nCons:\n- Can be a bit pricey compared to regular sugar\n- Color can be slightly lighter than regular sugar\n\nOverall, I highly recommend giving Allulose Sweetener a try. It's a versatile option for baking and beverages, and it's a great choice for anyone looking to cut back on sugar or avoid animal products. It may be a bit more expensive than regular sugar, but in my opinion, it's totally worth it.\n\nBottom line: Allulose Sweetener gets a solid 8 out of 10 from me.

But when I discovered La Tourangelle's Avocado Oil, I knew I had hit the jackpot. Not only is it an amazing substitute for butter in recipes, but it's also great for your skin and hair. Talk about a multitasking superstar!\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the taste. La Tourangelle's avocado oil has a delicious light fruity flavor that adds a little something special to any dish. I've used it in everything from banana bread to cornbread without egg and it always turns out perfectly moist and flavorful. Plus, it's a great vegan egg baking option for those who are looking to cut down on animal products in their diet.\n\nBut what really sold me on this oil was the fact that it's also great for your body. The oleic acid found in avocado oil is known for its cholesterol-lowering properties, and it's even been shown to improve overall heart health. Plus, it's a fantastic moisturizer for your skin and hair. I've been using it on my face before bed and my skin has never felt smoother or looked more radiant.\n\nOf course, there are a few cons to keep in mind. For one, the price is a bit steep compared to other oils on the market. And while I love the emerald green color of the oil, some people might find it a bit off-putting. But honestly, those are pretty minor issues in the grand scheme of things.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend La Tourangelle's Avocado Oil to anyone who's looking for an egg substitute for brownie mix or just wants to add a little extra flavor to their cooking. It's a versatile and healthy ingredient that's definitely worth the investment. Plus, the fact that it's handcrafted from premium avocados just makes it feel all the more special.\n\nBottom Line: If you're an egg-free baker or just a health-conscious foodie, you won't regret adding La Tourangelle's All-Natural Avocado Oil to your pantry.

Now, I know some of y'all might be thinking, \"Why would I get pancake mix when I can just make it from scratch?\" But hear me out, this mix is a game changer for those of us with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. \n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the ingredients. King Arthur gluten free pancake mix is not only certified gluten-free, but it's also non-GMO project verified and certified kosher. So you know you're getting a quality product that's safe to eat. Plus, the mix is super easy to make. All you need to do is add water and some oil (I like using applesauce instead of oil for a healthier option), and voila! You've got yourself some delicious gluten free pancakes. \n\nBut what really sets this mix apart is the taste. It's fluffy, light, and doesn't have that weird grainy texture that some gluten free products have. It's the perfect balance of sweetness and savory, and pairs well with anything from maple syrup to fresh fruit. Trust me, you won't even be able to tell that it's gluten free. \n\nNow, who would this product be a good fit for? Obviously, it's great for those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, but it's also a good option for anyone who wants to incorporate more gluten free options into their diet. It's especially great for busy mornings when you don't have time to make pancakes from scratch, but still want something tasty and satisfying. \n\nPro:\n- Certified gluten-free, non-GMO project verified, and certified kosher\n- Easy to make\n- Fluffy and delicious\n- Perfect for busy mornings\n\nCon:\n- Slightly more expensive than regular pancake mix (but worth it for the quality)\n\nBottom Line:\nKing Arthur Gluten Free Pancake Mix is a must-try for anyone with gluten intolerance or celiac disease. It's easy to make, delicious, and doesn't compromise on taste or texture. I give it an 8.5/10!",

That's where the School Testing Headset comes in! With a boom microphone and mobile ready plug, these babies will drown out all the distracting commotion and let you concentrate on what really matters: answering those grade-defining questions. \n\nBut don't just take it from me, Emma, the egg-free cook. I've never been much of a test-taker myself (I'm more of a cookie-baker, if you know what I mean), but I know a good product when I see one. And these headsets are legit. They're lightweight, comfortable, and have a standard 3.5mm TRSS plug that works with most devices. Plus, they come in a pack of ten, so you can share them with your study group and all enjoy some much-needed peace and quiet. \n\nWho would benefit from these headsets, you ask? Well, anyone who needs to take a test in a loud or distracting environment, for starters. That includes students of all ages, from elementary schoolers taking spelling tests to college students cramming for finals. But these headsets could also be useful for other activities that require concentration, like online gaming or video conferencing. \n\nNow, let's break it down with a pro-con list: \n\nPros: \n- Affordable price for a pack of ten \n- Boom microphone ensures crystal-clear audio \n- Mobile ready plug works with most devices \n- Lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods \n- Perfect for test-taking or other activities that require concentration \n\nCons: \n- Only comes in one color (black) \n- May not fit comfortably on all head sizes \n- Not wireless, so cords could get tangled or caught on something \n\nIn conclusion, if you're a student who needs to take tests in a loud environment or just someone who needs to concentrate on audio-based activities, the School Testing Headset is definitely worth considering. While it may not be perfect for everyone, its many benefits (including affordability and crystal-clear audio) make it a top contender in the headset game. So go ahead and give it a try - your GPA (or gaming skills) will thank you! \n\nBottom line: 8/10 stars.",

It's me, Emma, back at it again with another review - this time for Beyond Purina High Protein Adult Dry Dog Food, Organic Chicken, Egg & Sweet Potato Recipe - 6 lb. Bag!

Well, because this dog food is not just any old dog food - it's high in protein, organic, and made with sweet potato!

This dog food is made with real, organic chicken and sweet potato, which are both great sources of protein and fiber. But what sets this dog food apart is the addition of eggs, which provide an extra boost of protein that your pup needs to stay strong and healthy. Plus, the eggs are organic, so you don't have to worry about any harmful chemicals or additives.\n\nAnother thing I love about Beyond Purina High Protein Adult Dry Dog Food is the fact that it's made with high-quality, natural ingredients.

I would say it's perfect for any dog that needs a high-protein, nutrient-dense diet. This could be a working dog, a dog that's very active, or a dog that needs to put on some weight. It's also great for dogs with sensitive stomachs, as the natural ingredients are easy to digest.\n\nNow, let's get to the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Made with real, organic chicken and sweet potato\n- High in protein and easy to digest\n- No artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives\n- Great for dogs with sensitive stomachs\n- Provides extra nutrition for active dogs or dogs that need to put on weight\n\nCons:\n- Some dogs may not like the taste (but let's be honest, some dogs will eat anything!)\n\nIn conclusion, Beyond Purina High Protein Adult Dry Dog Food, Organic Chicken, Egg & Sweet Potato Recipe - 6 lb. Bag is an egg-cellent choice for any dog that needs a high-protein, nutrient-dense diet. With real, organic ingredients and no artificial additives, you can feel good about feeding this to your furry friend.

I can see these eggs being a hit with kids and adults alike.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"Emma, these are collectible toys, not egg substitutes!\" And you're right, they don't have anything to do with baking.

The cute little tub makes it easy to store in your pantry without taking up too much space.

The cookies came out fluffy and moist, with no weird aftertaste. \n\nOne of the things I love about this product is how versatile it is. You can use it as a substitute for 1 egg in any recipe, or use it as a breading for meats and veggies. And if you're like me and don't have any flaxseed meal or chia seeds on hand, this is a great egg substitute for baking brownies or chocolate chip cookies. \n\nOf course, as with any product, there are pros and cons. Here's what I came up with: \n\nPros:\n- Tastes just like regular eggs\n- Versatile and easy to use\n- Long shelf life\n\nCons:\n- A bit on the pricey side\n- Contains dairy (if you have a dairy allergy)\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend Augason Farms Dried Whole Egg Powder to anyone with an egg allergy or intolerance.

            "content": "First of all, let's talk about the nonstick ceramic coating. It's seriously magic - nothing sticks to these pans, not even that stubborn melted cheese on your homemade pizza. And unlike other nonstick coatings that can contain harmful chemicals like PTFE and PFOA, this set is totally non-toxic and safe for you and your family to use.\n\nThe aluminized steel body of the bakeware is also a huge plus. It heats evenly and quickly, so you don't have to worry about your baked goods coming out undercooked in some spots and overcooked in others. And the included cooling rack is a lifesaver - no more trying to balance hot pans on top of each other on the counter.\n\nOne of the coolest things about this set is the color - it's called Perracotta and it's seriously gorgeous. It's like if terracotta and peach had a baby. I know color might not matter to some people, but let's be real - we all want our kitchen to look cute and coordinated.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Caraway Nonstick Ceramic Bakeware Set for anyone who loves to bake. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a newbie baker, this set is a must-have. And for those of us with egg allergies or intolerances, it's an especially great option. No more struggling with sticky pans or uneven cooking - just delicious baked goods every time.\n\nPros:\n- Non-toxic nonstick ceramic coating\n- Aluminized steel body heats evenly and quickly\n- Included cooling rack\n- Beautiful Perracotta color\n\nCons:\n- Pricey at $395\n- Some pieces might be too large for smaller kitchens or ovens\n\nBottom line: If you're serious about baking and want a set of high-quality, non-toxic bakeware that will last for years, the Caraway Nonstick Ceramic Bakeware Set is definitely worth the investment.

            "content": "Hey there, fellow allergen-avoiders! It's Emma from Egg Free Cook, and today I'm here to talk to you about the Ora Organic Vegan Protein Powder. This stuff is the real deal! Not only is it vegan, keto-friendly, gluten-free, dairy-free, and soy-free, but it's also made with 21g of plant-based protein per serving. That's the kind of fuel we need to power through our busy days, am I right?\n\nWhat I love about this protein powder is that it's versatile AF. You can mix it with water, milk, or even non-dairy alternatives like almond or coconut milk for a quick and easy protein boost. Or, you can get creative and use it in your favorite smoothies, pancakes, or even brownie recipes (yes, you read that right!). It's the perfect egg substitute for baking brownies without sacrificing taste or texture.\n\nAnd let me tell you, the vanilla flavor is on-point. It's not too sweet or overpowering, so you can easily mix it with other ingredients without worrying about it clashing with your flavor profile. Plus, the low net carbs make it a great option for those of us trying to cut back on our sugar intake. \n\nNow, let's get down to the nitty-gritty with a good ol' pro-con list, shall we?\n\nPros:\n- Vegan, keto-friendly, gluten-free, dairy-free, and soy-free\n- 21g of plant-based protein per serving\n- Versatile AF - mix it with water, milk, or use as an egg substitute for baking\n- Delicious vanilla flavor that's not too sweet\n- Low net carbs for a healthy protein boost\n\nCons:\n- The vanilla flavor might not be strong enough for those who prefer a more intense taste\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Ora Organic Vegan Protein Powder. It's a game-changer for those of us with egg allergies or intolerances, or for anyone looking to add some plant-based protein to their diet. Just be sure to read the label carefully if you have any other food sensitivities to avoid any egg allergy symptoms or egg intolerance symptoms in adults.\n\nBottom Line: 8.5/10 - A delicious and versatile protein powder that won't give you a rash!",

            "content": "If you're looking for a chicken substitute in your recipes but are eggplant allergic or sensitive to egg, dairy, or meat, RC Fine Food's Vegan GF FlavorMatch\u00ae Chicken Flavor Base might just be your new go-to ingredient. As a food blogger and recipe developer who loves creating egg-free recipes, I was excited to give this chicken-flavored broth a try. \n\nThe base comes in a 12-ounce container and can make 5 gallons of chicken-flavored broth, which is a great value for anyone who wants to make a large batch of soup, stew, or sauce. The granular base dissolves easily in hot water, and the final product has a golden color and a flavor that's pretty close to chicken broth. While I wouldn't say it is an exact replica of chicken broth, it definitely adds a savory umami flavor that can make your dishes taste more complex and satisfying. \n\nThis chicken-flavored base is also gluten-free, vegan, and Kosher Pareve certified, which makes it a versatile ingredient for people with different dietary needs. I can see it being a great fit for anyone who wants to reduce their meat consumption or experiment with vegan cooking. It's also a good option for people who have sudden egg intolerance symptoms or delayed egg allergy symptoms, as it doesn't contain any egg products. \n\nWhile I enjoyed using this chicken-flavored base, there are a few things to consider before buying it. For one, the base contains a fair amount of salt, so you might want to adjust the seasoning of your recipe accordingly. Also, the final product might not have exactly the same color as chicken broth, which might not matter in some recipes but could be a deal-breaker for others. \n\nPros: Vegan, GF, Kosher Pareve certified, adds savory flavor to dishes, good value for a large batch of broth. \nCons: Contains salt, might not have the exact same color as chicken broth. \n\nOverall, I think RC Fine Food's Vegan GF FlavorMatch\u00ae Chicken Flavor Base is a solid option for anyone who wants to add a chicken-like flavor to their recipes without using any actual chicken. It's not a perfect substitute, but it can definitely elevate the taste of your dishes and make them more interesting. As someone who's always on the lookout for egg-free baking and cooking ingredients, I appreciate that the base is egg-free, dairy-free, and meat-free, too.

It's like having an army of egg-peeling robots at your service.\n\nAs an egg-free cook, I know how annoying it is to peel eggs manually, especially when you need a lot of them for your recipe. It's time-consuming and messy, and sometimes you end up with broken egg whites or yolk on your hands. The jucyuanhang Egg Peeler solves all those problems. It's made of food-grade 304 stainless steel, so it's safe and durable. It has a low breakage rate, so you won't waste any eggs. And it's easy to clean, so you won't have to spend hours scrubbing eggshells.\n\nWho would benefit from the jucyuanhang Egg Peeler?

It can peel all kinds of eggs, such as loose eggs, preserved eggs, and boiled eggs. And if you're an egg-free cook like me, you'll love how efficient and hassle-free this machine is.

As a food blogger who specializes in egg-free recipes, I'm always on the lookout for plant-based protein sources, and this one is a winner.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the taste. Some protein powders can be chalky, gritty, or just plain gross, but this one is smooth, creamy, and tastes like a peanut butter milkshake. It's perfect for post-workout recovery or as a meal replacement when you're on the go. Plus, it comes in a 4.4lb container with 45 servings, so it's a great value for the price.\n\nBut taste isn't the only thing that matters. Vega Sport Premium Vegan Protein Powder also packs a nutritional punch with 30g of protein per serving, plus 5g of BCAAs, tart cherry, and probiotics to help with muscle recovery and digestion. And because it's made from pea protein, it's a complete protein source with all nine essential amino acids.\n\nWho would this product be a good fit for? Well, pretty much anyone who wants to add more plant-based protein to their diet. Whether you're a vegan athlete, a keto dieter, or just someone who wants to cut back on animal products, Vega Sport Premium Vegan Protein Powder is a great option. It's also great for anyone with egg or dairy allergies or sensitivities.\n\nPro:\n- Delicious peanut butter flavor\n- 30g of plant-based protein per serving\n- Complete protein source with all 9 essential amino acids\n- Vegan, keto-friendly, gluten-free, and non-GMO\n- Large container with 45 servings\n\nCons:\n- Packaging may vary\n- May not mix as well as some other protein powders\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a high-quality plant-based protein powder that actually tastes good, then Vega Sport Premium Vegan Protein Powder in Peanut Butter flavor is definitely worth trying. As someone who knows firsthand the struggles of finding egg-free and dairy-free protein sources, I highly recommend this product. It's a great addition to any smoothie or shake, or even as a secret ingredient in recipes like egg-free brownies or cornbread without egg. So go ahead, give it a try, and fuel your plant-based performance. \n\nBottom Line: 8.5/10",

That's why I was stoked to try out this Powdered Whole Milk - it's bulk size and long shelf life make it perfect for emergency food storage, but it's also great for everyday use in recipes like cereal, coffee, tea, and more!\n\nFirst of all, the fact that this milk powder is non-GMO and gluten-free is a major plus in my book. And because it's a whole milk powder, it has a richer flavor and creamier texture than skim milk powder. I tested it out in a few different recipes, including an egg-free pancake recipe and some egg-free brownies, and the results were amazing. The milk powder dissolved easily in the batter and helped create a tender, moist texture in both the pancakes and brownies.\n\nAnother thing I love about this milk powder is that it's so versatile. I've used it in everything from creamy sauces to homemade ice cream, and it always delivers great results. And because it's a dry ingredient, it's super convenient to store and use whenever I need it.\n\nPros:\n- Long shelf life makes it perfect for emergency food storage\n- Whole milk powder has a richer flavor and creamier texture than skim milk powder\n- Non-GMO and gluten-free\n- Versatile ingredient that can be used in both sweet and savory recipes\n\nCons:\n- The color is a bit off-putting at first (but it doesn't affect the flavor or performance!)\n\nBottom Line: Whether you're stocking up for an emergency or just looking for a convenient ingredient to use in your everyday cooking and baking, this Powdered Whole Milk is a game-changer. I highly recommend it, and give it an 8 out of 10!",

If you're like me and can't handle those pesky eggs in your diet, you know how hard it can be to find a good substitute for baking. That's where oat fiber comes in, my friends!\n\nWhat I love about Anthony's Organic Oat Fiber is that it's not just egg-free, it's also gluten-free, non-GMO, and keto-friendly. Plus, it's made right here in the good ol' US of A. This means I can feel good about using it in my recipes, and I'm sure you will too.\n\nThis oat fiber is seriously versatile. You can use it as a flour substitute in all sorts of recipes, from cakes to brownies to pancakes. I've even used it to make a killer egg-free French toast. The texture is light and fluffy, and it doesn't have that weird aftertaste that some gluten-free flours can have.\n\nPro:\n- Egg-free, gluten-free, non-GMO, and keto-friendly. What more could you ask for?\n- Made in the USA!\n- Versatile and can be used in a variety of recipes.\n- Light and fluffy texture with no weird aftertaste.\n\nCon:\n- The color is a bit darker than regular flour, but that's to be expected with oat fiber.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Anthony's Organic Oat Fiber to anyone looking for an egg-free and gluten-free flour substitute. It's a great addition to any pantry, whether you're an egg allergy sufferer like me or just looking to mix up your baking routine. So go ahead and give it a try, and let me know what you think!\n\nBottom Line: 8.5/10",

As someone who loves to cook without eggs, I'm always on the hunt for good egg substitutes. And chia seeds are a great choice!\n\nNot only are these chia seeds organic, non-GMO, vegan, and gluten-free, but they also have a ton of nutritional benefits. They are high in fiber, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids. Plus, they can help you feel fuller for longer and may even reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\nOne of the best things about chia seeds is their ability to absorb liquid and become plump and sweeter when soaked. This makes them perfect for adding to smoothies, oatmeal, or yogurt. You can also use them as an egg replacement in baking. When mixed with water, chia seeds become gel-like and can help bind ingredients together in recipes like brownies or cookies.\n\nOn the downside, chia seeds can be a bit expensive, and the black ones can sometimes get stuck in your teeth. But these are minor cons compared to all the benefits you'll get from incorporating chia seeds into your diet.\n\nOverall, Yupik Organic Raw Black Chia Seeds are a great choice for anyone looking for a healthy and versatile ingredient. They're perfect for people with egg allergies or intolerances, and they're a great addition to any pantry.

            "content": "First off, let me just say that this stuff is the FINS of all egg substitutes. It's made from red algae, which might sound weird, but trust me, it does the job. I've used it as an egg substitute for waffles, cake, cookies, banana bread, brownie mix, and even cornbread - and every time it has worked like a charm.\n\nOne of the things I love about this product is that it doesn't change the flavor of your baked goods. Unlike some other egg substitutes like applesauce or banana, you won't be able to taste the agar agar powder in your final product. It's also great for those who have an egg plant allergy or are vegan and looking for a vegan egg baking solution.\n\nNow for the PROS and CONS:\n\nPROS:\n- Works as a 1:1 egg substitute in a variety of baked goods\n- Doesn't change the flavor of your final product\n- Made from 100% natural red algae\n- Gluten-free, non-GMO, sugar-free, and halal\n- Can be used as a thickener in sauces and puddings\n\nCONS:\n- It can make your baked goods slightly darker in color (but who cares about that when it tastes great, am I right?)\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for an egg-free recipe solution, the LIVING JIN Agar Agar Powder is definitely worth a try. It's versatile, easy to use, and won't change the flavor of your final product. Plus, it's made from natural ingredients, which is always a plus in my book. So, go ahead and give it a go - I give it an 8.5 out of 10.",
